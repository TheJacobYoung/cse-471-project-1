Additive Synthesizer:

-Overview:
   -The additive synthesizer works by adding together sinusoids to make a sound
   
-Compoenents to support:
    -Polyphony (Implemented):
		-Polyphony simply means playing more than one note at a time.
		-When you strum a guitar, you are playing six notes at a time.
		-Polyphony means being able to start and stop more than one note at the same time.
	
	-Glissando (Implemented):
		-Means a smooth transition between notes.
	
	-Cross-fading (Implemented):
		-The idea of sound cross-fading is that you generate a single note from more
		 than one set of sound definitions.
		-You might start with note with sound A, then gradually change to sound B by
		 interpolating between them
		-Cross-fading allows for richer sounds, since the sound varies over its period.
		
	-Envelope generation (Implemented):
		-How an instrument starts the sound and sustains it varies, but usually has a volume
		 characteristic to it
		-An example, a violin may slowly start the sound of a note or quickly start it for different songs.
		-This is called an "attack".  Many instruments have a rapid decay after the attack, then sustain at another level,
		 only to gradually decay at the end

-Grading Critera:
	10 - Sinusoid playback on demand from the sequencer (Implemented throughout demo)
	20 - Definition of all harmonics                    (Implemented during second section of demo)
	30 - Envelope generation                            (Implemented throughout demo)
	35 - Polyphony                                      (Implemented in second section of demo)
	40 - Sound cross-fading                             (Implemented in third section of demo)
	50 - Vibrato OR glissando                           (Both implemented: Vibrato in fourth section, gliss. in first section)

	Attributes include:
		-measure: measure of the score
		-beat: beat number within the measure
		-duration: duration of the note in beats
		-[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5]: You can include up to 5 simultaneous amplitudes. Uninstantiated amplitudes
							   defult to 0
		-FadeIn/FadeOut: Sets the beat duration of fading in or out for that note
		-vibrato: Takes two parameters. The first describes the frequency while the second describes the amplitude
		-note: The note you want to play
